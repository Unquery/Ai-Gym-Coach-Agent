# AI Gym Coach Agent

An AI-powered workout logging and progress analysis assistant built as a Junior AI Engineering portfolio project.

**Status:** Milestone 1 — minimal FastAPI application with a tested health endpoint.

See [`docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) and [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

The MVP will use Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and safe LLM tool calling to retrieve training logs, suggest sessions, record confirmed sets, and calculate progress.

## Setup (Windows PowerShell)

Prerequisites: Python 3.12 and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
If uv is missing, install it, then reopen PowerShell so PATH is refreshed:

```powershell
winget install --id=astral-sh.uv -e
```

From the repository root:

```powershell
Set-Location E:\AIGymCoach
uv --version
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = Join-Path (Get-Location) ".uv-cache"
# Only needed if Python 3.12 is not already installed:
uv python install 3.12
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked python --version
```

`.python-version` selects Python 3.12. `uv sync --locked` creates `.venv` and
installs the dependencies (including test tools) at the versions in `uv.lock`.
The session variable keeps uv's cache inside this repository; set it again in each
new shell if the default user cache is not writable. No virtual environment
activation, database, API key, or `.env` file is needed for this milestone.

## Run

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = Join-Path (Get-Location) ".uv-cache"
uv run --locked uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs> for the interactive API documentation.
In a second PowerShell window, check the running application:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

`GET /health` returns HTTP 200 with JSON `{"status":"ok"}`. This endpoint checks
that the application responds; it does not check database or LLM availability.
Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

## Test

```powershell
$env:UV_CACHE_DIR = Join-Path (Get-Location) ".uv-cache"
uv run --locked pytest
```

The test uses FastAPI's `TestClient` to check the health endpoint's status,
content type, and JSON body without starting a server or making paid API calls.

If a Windows sandbox reports `PytestCacheWarning` while creating its temporary
cache directory, pre-create the ignored cache directory, then rerun the test:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path .pytest_cache -Force | Out-Null
uv run --locked pytest
```

## Layout

```text
app/main.py           FastAPI application and health route
tests/test_health.py  HTTP contract test
pyproject.toml        Runtime/dev dependencies and pytest configuration
uv.lock               Resolved dependency versions; keep in version control
docs/                 Project context and roadmap
```
